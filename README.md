## Motivation

 >I proclaim myself as a tech-savvy, and everything I want is to explore most of technology trends that were emerged around the globe. One of them is AI. I think AI was cool. When I first develop an Augmented Reality (AR) and Opcical Character Recognition (OCR) [applications](https://berodimas.netlify.app/project/robotics-ar/), my first though was 'Are these this easy?'. I genuinely though I was kinda 'mastering' this technologies, while I'm only using an Open Source SDK and Libraries.

 >Then, I'm getting more fascinated about the motive and development behind those algorithms. The more I read papers, the more it got me like 'What the hell are they talking about?'. Turns out I don't understand anything, like, at all. It feels like all of this times I was just a kid who's swimming with the life vest on, in the middle of the ocean. There's so much things I need to learn, I need to understand, and I want to master those!

>Gratefully I got an opportunity and facilities to learn AI at the company that I work for. 'So, now you're a Data Scientist?'. I won't say yes, but most of my projects was related to ML Engineering and Application Development things. 

>Even though, I still feel insufficient. When you work for a company, you will handle a real data, and it was the required things to be a better Data Scientist. But the problem you'll rarely got a new cases each month (mostly once one case's done, the next step is to scale, maintain, monitor, evaluate, etc, back and forth on your AI Framework, go look up for [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) or [IBM AI Ladder](https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/dev-hub/machine-learning-dev/ai-ladder/)). I also want to solve any other cases, like Time Series Analysis, Recommendation System, Computer Vision, etc. Then I though why don't I just find the cases myself?

>Fortunately, I'm surrounded with [peoples](#participants) who's also wants to learn new things. They might not work as a Data Scientist things, they just want to know about it. We decided to study one dataset per-month. We take the dataset from everywhere as long as it's public. Three main focus is to-do: Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Model Building. Hope we would be better and learn a new things each months!

>I really wish for a feedback, I'm aware that my analysis was far from great. If there's any feedback or you also want to participate, kindly contact me at [Reach Me Out](#reach-me-out) below.
